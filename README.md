# Vector8015
3D model of a Support frame system for the Vector P/N 8015 pad-per-hole proto-board.

September, 2024

This support frame is for the Vector P/N 8015 pad-per-hole prototype PCB which is available from any distributor of
Vector products (such as mouser.com or digikey.com).  It provides a stable base for the PCB using the 8 mounting holes
present along the PCB periphery.  In addition, 4 optional internal support hole locations are provided if additional
support is desired.  In the OpenSCAD source code, a template output option is available.  This template is intended
to aid in the location and drilling of the internal mounting holes on the Vector PCB.
The 4 holes are modeled to fall on existing PCB pad locations, which aids in
drilling (or marking of the boss locations, on the bottom side of the PCB, should only unilateral support be
required).  The mounting "bosses" are designed to accept #2 self-tapping screws.

On the "front panel" of the support frame, holes are placed and sized to accept banana jacks to allow for the placement
of switches or jacks as might be required for a given application.
